Hello! This is a small project I completed over the summer as I was curious about learning some PHP and creating a website that could interact with a database.
I found completing this project to be very fun, and databases/php are becoming a passion of mine! 

I didn't want to focus on CSS for this project, so I used Bootstrap to make my form presentable instead!

However, when testing I used XAMPP to run Apache and phpmyadmin LOCALLY on my machine.
Therefore, I have not tested it in any other environment. 

---- This is just a basic passion project. As a result, it may not work ----
